Also takes album art from associated folder.\r\n\r\nBy default fsm plays songs from ~/Music\r\n\r\nfsm is written in python and uses the GTK toolkit for its gui and the GStreamer python bindings for audio playback. If your python can successfully import the gtk and gst modules it should work.\r\n\r\nknown bugs: reproccesses all album art on startup, which takse a very long time\r\n","name":"fsm"}
